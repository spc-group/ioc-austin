* Dashboard (25idAustin:dashboard)
- *PUT PV* is the name of the PV appended to the prefix
  (e.g. 25idAustin:dashboard:play).
- *PUT cmd* is the command that is sent over the wire to the robot
  (i.e. dashboard command).
- *GET PV* is the corresponding PV for retrieving the value the value.
- *Scan cmd* is the command that is sent over the wire periodically
  (e.g. 0.5 sec) to check for new values.

  * This :safety_status PV should use the SafetyStatus enum, but some
    of the strings are longer than the 26 character limit, and so this
    will need to be factored.

** Questions
   1. Are scanned parameters correct?
   2. How does "calibrate" relate to the calibrated positions?
   3. Do we need a global lock for comms via urx?
* Actions

  Each action represents a python function.
  
  The IOC get PVs for the typed arguments to the function, plus PVs to
  run the function (:Process), report busy status (:Status), and return a value (:Retval).
